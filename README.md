# Zalo Integration SDK

This is a work in progress project. **Use at your own risk!**

At this point, this library only support Official Account APIs.

If you found any problems, please create an issue to track it, or feel free to open a PR.

## Installation

`pip install zalo_sdk`

## Build and Release

- Bump new version in setup.py
- Build and upload to pypi.org
```
python3 -m build
python3 -m twine upload dist/*
```

## Documentation

The code is its own document.

(I'm kidding, I'll add documentation later)

## Running the Test Cases
To run the test cases, use the following command:
```
python test/test_file_name.py
```
Replace `test_file_name.py` with the name of the test file you want to run.

Each test case will print the response from the API after running.
